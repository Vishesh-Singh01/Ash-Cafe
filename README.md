# Ash-Cafe
I hereby declare that the project titled “Ash Café Website Landing Page” is the
result of my own independent work carried out during the course of my learning and
training. This project has been completed by me with complete honesty, dedication,
and sincerity. The work presented in this report has not been submitted, copied, or
reproduced from any other student, institute, or source. The ideas, structure, coding
patterns, and explanations used in the development of this Ash Care website are
based on my understanding, research, and the practical skills I gained during the
learning process.
